## About The Project

This project is a web application prototype built with React. Developed as part of my Vocational Training Advanced Level in Computing – Multi-platform Application Development course. While the project also touches on responsive design, interactive features, and other modern web technologies, its primary focus is on deepening my skills in React. It serves as a dynamic learning environment where I experiment with React components, state management  and best practices in modern web development. The website includes:

- A home page with an introduction, statistics, and a profile image.
- A portfolio section dynamically generated from an array of project objects.
- A contact page featuring an interactive map powered by React Leaflet, along with contact details and a contact form.
